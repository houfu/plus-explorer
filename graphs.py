    On 31 December 2021, the [Attorney General Chambers of Singapore completed a universal revision of 
Singapore's Acts of Parliament](https://www.agc.gov.sg/our-roles/drafter-of-laws/legislation-and-revisions).
Among other changes implemented, **"Plain English is used as much as possible"**. 
A list of the types of changes made can be found [here](https://www-agc-gov-sg-admin.cwp.sg/docs/default-source/our-roles-documents/drafter-of-laws/list-of-standard-revision-changes.pdf).

Let's visualise how much the changes affected readability using common readability tests.
    
To do this, we bunch up a selection of random clauses so that we can see two things:
* Whether the change improved or worsened the readability of the section. 
    * A Red circle represents the original readability score.
    * A Blue circle represents the new readability score.
    * A red line between them shows the change worsened the readability score.
    * A blue line between them shows the change improved the readability score.
* How much the change improved or worsened the readability of the section.
    * This is shown by the distance between the circle.


_A note on the selection of sections_

I manually and randomly selected 150 sections from Statutes Singapore Online and picked the latest 2020 Rev Edn version
and compared it with the _immediately preceding_ version. 

By random, 
I mean that I went through a list of legislation, 
picked one that seems interesting 
and then picked a section which sounded interesting, 
keeping in mind that I would like a variety of clauses in the dataset. 
Some sections experienced _no changes at all_, 
I left them inside the dataset as it was important to show that not all sections are affected by changes.

    It uses a list of 3000 words that groups of fourth-grade American students 
    could reliably understand, considering any word not on that list to be difficult.
